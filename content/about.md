## Hi, I'm Lakshman 👋

I'm a Data Scientist with a curiosity for understanding how language models work from the ground up and the analogies to our own brain. I believe the best way to learn something is to build it yourself. I recently got my hands on an **NVIDIA DGX Spark** and I'm planning to use it to train/fine-tune open source LLMs for fun personal projects and research. This blog will document what I learn along the way.
