## Hi, I'm Lakshman 👋

I'm an ML engineer with a passion for understanding how large language models work — from the ground up. I believe the best way to learn something is to build it yourself.

### What I'm Working On

I recently got my hands on an **NVIDIA DGX Spark** — a desktop-class Grace Blackwell supercomputer — and I'm using it to train LLMs from scratch. This blog documents what I learn along the way.

### The Setup

- **Hardware**: NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip)
- **Memory**: 128 GB unified CPU+GPU
- **GPU**: 1x GB10 (Blackwell architecture)
- **Favorite tool**: [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) by Andrej Karpathy
